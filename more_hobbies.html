          <h1>What Do I Like To Do For Fun!?</h1>
        
          <h2>Well, I Watch An Awful Lot of MMA/UFC</h2>
          <h3>Hands down my favorite past time.</h3>
          <p>I've been into mixed martial arts for many years, mainly becuase I think it's cool and admirable. That might sound crazy but, I don't know, I guess there's just something about two grown adults competeing in fair combat that is unlike anything else. I don't really watch other sports
            but I can easily watch the full UFC fight card on a Saturdays if I'm not working. Even if I am working, chances are I'm watching the fights on my phone or tablet or something. I'm sitting here thinking about it, and yea, 
            sometimes fight cards have 10+ fights scheduled for one night, and I'll watch all of them. I can appreciate where dicipline meets art. I like analyzing the striking, defense, head movement, countering, fainting, kicking, timing 
            of strikes, there's just so much that goes into combat sports its crazy. Plus I love a good highlight K.O. Needless to say, I watch most of the UFC events from start to finish, which can sometimes span 4-6 hours, most weekends.
            So that's probably my main hobby.

          <h2>Podcasts, Music, Netflix, and Chill</h2>
          <h3>Cause who doesn't?</h3>
            <p>If I'm not watching fights, I'm probably just chillin with the wifey. Watching some movies, listening to podcasts, and scrolling through our phones usually right next to each other. We also enjoy time with our dog. We play with him 
                and give him attention as much as we can. 
            </p>
        
            <p>We also listen to a lot of music and hang out with friends. Her friends come over a lot and we have drinks and dance in the living room to cumbia and all kinds of music really. We try to have a good time. Work can be so 
                stressful for both of us so we try to keep it lively as much as possible and keep the good times rollin.

        <h2>So Why Do I Want To Be A Developer?</h2>
        <h3>Many reasons, here's the gist.</h3>
            <p>I have always been a fan of online businesses such as ecommerce sites, dropshipping stores, and follow a lot of tech entreprenuers online. I have tried to play around here and there with building websites, but nothing like this.
                I've used wix, weebly, shopify, and wordpress in the past to make litte sites here and there for various endevours. I thought those drag and drop website building platforms were cool, and I just recently started to realize how complex 
                coding a whole site from scratch actually is. I wanted to become a developer because I think AI is at a point where if you do not adapt to it now, or learn how to use it for financial gain, or at least know how to work with it, 
                you will be at a major disatvantage. I think joining this course is a great place to start. I will gain the fundamentals of how coding works, and then I can just keep learning other languages, take other courses, so on and so forth
                because it is my belief, that those that do not do what they can to learn how things are changing, will be left behind. Maybe not, but I'm here primarily because of that. And because I want to change industries and careers. I've been 
                doing insurance for almost a decade, and I'd rather switch now to a different industry, so that in the <em>next</em> decade, I can be better positioned.
