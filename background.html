    <h1>So, What's My Background? Who am I?</h1>
  
    <h2>Child/Adolescent Omar</h2>
    <p>I grew up in California (born and raised). I'm hispanic, with Mexican and Salvadorean parents. Growing up here was cool, I was born in a small agricultural town in the central valley so it was pretty lowkey and often times boring.
      I kept to myslef and my small group of friends and I liked it that way. When I was 8 my father passed away so I just tended to keep to myslef pretty much after that, which is why I just kept a small circle. It was hard for people to 
      understand. I myslf had trouble understanding my place in the world from a young age. In highschool I realized that I needed some sort of guidance since my mom was just working all the time to keep us fed and all that stuff. Typical
      around here actally, a lot of my friends had migrant worker parents. I started getting into social media and found some role models who I looked up to online. I couldn't find people in real life to offer help/guidance, so this 
      really had a large impact on my life. I saw people that were making a bunch of money, living a good life, and they claimed that they were also born without many resources, and I thought, hmm, if they could do it why can't I?

    <h2>Adult Omar</h2>
      <p>With newfound hope I decided to take action. I had been listening/following some people online for a while so I thought, alright, time to try this. That's where I got my start in sales. I had all these ideas, and was telling myself 
      that I could make it in the world without needing to go to college. The people online did it, why not me? So I followed the advice that I received. They said, go into sales, find a commision based job and get good at speaking and 
      selling. So I did. I was 18 and was recruited to this insurance company offering commision pay so that's where I got my start. At 18 I got licensed and joined a team and started making some monies. I was able to move out, get an 
      appartment and be on my own. I eventually was promoted and was in charge of my own office, but long story short, after an excruciating few years I was burnt out. I got a different possition at a different company and been working
      there ever since. That allowed me to venture out and try starting a couple of different businesses over the years, which all eventually failed. I saw the trend with AI and just tech in general and how fast everything is moving and 
      evolving, so I thought why not just start now. And here we are :)

      I am also now happily engaged. In April I asked my girlfriend of 3 years to marry me and she said she would so now we are planning a wedding for some time late 2024. I don't have all the details hashed out yet, but we will get there.
      She is a nurse and we have an apartment together in Clovis, CA where she works. It's just me, her, and our dog Nixon.
